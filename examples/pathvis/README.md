This is a uv python project used to visualize the path generated by the `3dof` or `ur3e` examples. 
After you run either example with cargo, change into the pathvis directory and run one of the following commands to generate the visual.

`uv run vis.py ../3dof/path.json`

`uv run vis.py ../ur3e/path.json`

It will load the JSON and display the robot path.
